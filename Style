        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
        of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such 
        as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside 
        HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, 
        including layout, colors, and fonts.<span>Inline</span> This separation can improve content accessibility; 
        provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
        css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
        css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and 
        its formatting.
