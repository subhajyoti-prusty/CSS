    <p>Originally, India was scheduled to host the G20 summit in 2021 and Italy in 2022. 
        At the 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit in Argentina, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said 
        he had requested Italy to host the summit in 2021 and allow India to host it in 2022,
        on the occasion of the 75th year of India's independence. Italy agreed to let India
         host the G20 summit in 2022 in its place, owing to the momentum in bilateral ties.
        However, after a request made by Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, India 
        exchanged its presidency of the G20 with Indonesia because Indonesia would also chair 
        the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2023.
